PongAI
======

This was a project made to test working of LWJGL librry for Java. It is not part of any course work. This game is played by two AI agents with different strategies. One agent follows the ball whereever it goes, while the other agent calculates where the ball will land and moves to that position. Since the bat can move only at a certain speed at maximum, the lsecond agent fails if the ball moves at high speed.
